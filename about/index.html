<h2 id="experiences">Experiences</h2>
<p>Tina-Michelle has been active in dance since the age of 2. Initially, she studied ballet, tap, jazz, gymnastics, modern, and pointe. She later began exploring international rhythms, such as Latin, West African, Haitian Folkloric, Afro-Cuban, and Bellydance.</p>
<p>Fitness went hand in hand with dance. Participating in both team and individual sports, boot camps, and personal training, she has always enjoyed practicing her athleticism. Her avid interest in health and fitness is what led her to pursue her degrees and certifications.</p>
<p>She was embarking on her career as a professional dancer when a vehicle unexpectedly turned left in front of the car she was riding in. The injuries left her bedridden for three years. Refusing to accept that she would “never walk again” and could “kiss her dancing days goodbye”, she walked her first mile on March 20, 2006 and began to write the rest of her life story.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy-approach">Philosophy | Approach</h2>
<p>Since “we all have our stories”, Tina-Michelle’s private training is tailored for the individual. She works with people to define their goals and provide focus. Because we are always developing, Tina-Michelle continually re-evaluates to provide a solid program that ensures achievement. </p>
<p>Tina-Michelle believes that a healthy lifestyle is more easily adapted when the approach is both manageable and desirable. Drawing upon her diverse background and extensive experience with rehabilitation, Tina-Michelle also implements corrective exercise and cognition in her program design. A strong foundation is the key to enhancing performance. The confidence that ensues is a side benefit.</p>
<h2 id="ventures">Ventures</h2>
<p>Tina-Michelle was primarily a private trainer, but taught her dance-fitness classes publicly. When demand quickly grew, however, Move Your Axis evolved from dance-fitness into a well-rounded lifestyle program to provide greater availability to enthusiasts. The array of options allows for a more individual approach to a healthy lifestyle. Move Your Axis is available <a href="http://live.moveyouraxis.com">live</a> and (soon to be) <a href="http://live.moveyouraxis.com">virtually</a>.</p>
