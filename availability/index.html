<p>I am currently unavailable until further notice.</p>
<p>For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries. Recovery Road is looking to be pretty long and intense.</p>
<p>I will provide an update once things become more clear.</p>
<p>Should you need to reach me in the meantime, please contact info@tina-michelle.com.</p>
