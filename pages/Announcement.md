##**ANNOUNCEMENT**##

I am currently unavailable until further notice.

For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries.  

Recovery Road is looking to be pretty long and intense since my right foot was the only spared body part.  

I will provide an update once things become more clear.

Should you need to reach me in the meantime, please contact info@tina-michelle.com.
