<u><h1 style="font-weight:900;">MOVE BETTER</h1></u>

Have you ever thought any of the following?  

__*•    Is this nagging pain something I need to see a doctor about or something I can take care of on my own?*__

__*•    I have a hard time balancing on one leg.  I wonder how I can get better at it.*__

__*•	I’m tired of throwing my back out.*__

__*•	How can I become faster or stronger?*__

__*•	What if the reason I have trouble with changing directions suddenly is because I have limited range of motion in my upper back or my ankle?*__

__*•    Is there such thing as being too flexible?*__

__*•	I’d like to execute a flawless pivot turn or keep up with everyone else on the basketball court.*__


Dancers, Navy SEALs, those who have never been able to touch their toes,.. The bottom line is a movement screen is for everyone.  It is an important tool to help identify weaknesses, imbalances, asymmetries, and limitations and is part of what I offer in my [personal training sessions](http://tina-michelle.com/).  For a limited time, I am offering a special.  

---

Here’s how it will work:

1.)	We’ll assess your basic movement patterns during a half hour, one-on-one movement screening.  You’ll receive 3 progressions that you’ll be able to do on your own.  These progressions will be specific to your needs.

2.)	Those who have a screening on June 26th, 28th, or 29th will be eligible for the **MOVE BETTER** program that will be offered for 3 weeks in July.  These one hour long sessions will include progressions that will continue to be tailored to your needs.  Measurements will be documented and a detailed analysis will be provided to you after our last session.
