# Movement Screening and Program #

Have you ever thought any of the following?  

---

__*•    Is this nagging pain something I need to see a doctor about or something I can take care of on my own?*__

__*•	I have a hard time balancing on one leg.  I wonder how I can get better at it.*__

__*•	I’m tired of throwing my back out.*__

__*•	How can I become faster or more powerful?*__

__*•	What if the reason I have trouble with changing directions suddenly is because I’m limited in my upper back or my ankle?*__

__*•	I’d like to execute a flawless pivot turn or keep up with everyone else on the basketball court.*__

---

The list of questions could go on and on.  The point is, it’s really for everybody.  

From dancers, to athletes, to someone who has never been able to touch his or her toes, part of what I offer in my [personal training sessions](http://www.tina-michelle.com) is a movement screen to help identify weaknesses, imbalances, asymmetries, and limitations.  

---

Here’s how it’ll work:

1.)	We’ll assess your basic movement patterns during a half hour, one-on-one movement screening.  You’ll receive 3 progressions that you’ll be able to do on your own.  These progressions will be specific to your needs.

2.)	I’ll offer a 3 week program: **MOVE BETTER**.  These one hour long sessions will include progressions that will continue to be tailored to your needs.  Measurements will be documented and a detailed analysis will be provided to you after our last session.
