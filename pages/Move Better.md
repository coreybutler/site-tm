<u><h1 style="font-weight:900;">MOVE BETTER</h1></u>

Have you ever thought any of the following?  


__*•    Is this nagging pain something I need to see a doctor about or something I can take care of on my own?*__

__*•	I have a hard time balancing on one leg.  I wonder how I can get better at it.*__

__*•	I’m tired of throwing my back out.*__

__*•	How can I become faster or more powerful?*__

__*•	What if the reason I have trouble with changing directions suddenly is because I’m limited in my upper back or my ankle?*__

__*•	I’d like to execute a flawless pivot turn or keep up with everyone else on the basketball court.*__


The list of questions could go on and on.  The point is, it’s really for everybody - whether you are a dancer, triathlete, or someone who has never been able to touch his or her toes.  

Part of what I offer in my [personal training sessions](http://www.tina-michelle.com) is a movement screen to help identify weaknesses, imbalances, asymmetries, and limitations.  For a limited time, I am offering a special.

---

Here’s how it will work:

1.)	We’ll assess your basic movement patterns during a half hour, one-on-one movement screening.  You’ll receive 3 progressions that you’ll be able to do on your own.  These progressions will be specific to your needs.

2.)	I’ll offer a 3 week program: **MOVE BETTER**.  These one hour long sessions will include progressions that will continue to be tailored to your needs.  Measurements will be documented and a detailed analysis will be provided to you after our last session.
