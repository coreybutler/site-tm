##**MOVE YOUR AXIS ANNOUNCEMENT**##

Move Your Axis needs to be on hold until further notice.  It is entirely possible that this will become permanent.  

For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries.  After taking a financial break, I am back to visiting with my doctors again.  We are only able to address two injuries at a time, so I picked right shoulder, right knee.  It appears that I have a torn labrum in my shoulder and a torn meniscus in my knee.  We are in the process of determining the next steps and it is likely I’ll need surgery.  One way or another, the recovery process for both types of injuries will take some time.  Since the only body part spared was my right foot, this is going to be quite a process as we work our way down the list.    

I will find out my next steps next month.
