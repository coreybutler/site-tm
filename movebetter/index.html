<p><u></u></p><h1 style="font-weight:900;"><u>MOVE BETTER</u></h1><p></p>
<p>Have you ever thought any of the following?  </p>
<p><strong><em>•    Is this nagging pain something I need to see a doctor about or something I can take care of on my own?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>•    I have a hard time balancing on one leg.  I wonder how I can get better at it.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>•    I’m tired of throwing my back out.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>•    How can I become faster or more powerful?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>•    What if the reason I have trouble with changing directions suddenly is because I’m limited in my upper back or my ankle?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>•    I’d like to execute a flawless pivot turn or keep up with everyone else on the basketball court.</em></strong></p>
<p>The list of questions could go on and on.  The point is, it’s really for everybody - whether you are a dancer, triathlete, or someone who has never been able to touch his or her toes.  </p>
<p>Part of what I offer in my <a href="http://www.tina-michelle.com">personal training sessions</a> is a movement screen to help identify weaknesses, imbalances, asymmetries, and limitations.  For a limited time, I am offering a special.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here’s how it will work:</p>
<p>1.)    We’ll assess your basic movement patterns during a half hour, one-on-one movement screening.  You’ll receive 3 progressions that you’ll be able to do on your own.  These progressions will be specific to your needs.</p>
<p>2.)    Anyone who has a screening on June 26th, 28th, or 29th will be eligible for the <strong>MOVE BETTER</strong> program that will be offered for 3 weeks in July.  These one hour long sessions will include progressions that will continue to be tailored to your needs.  Measurements will be documented and a detailed analysis will be provided to you after our last session.  </p>
