<h2 id="-announcement-"><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT</strong></h2>
<p>I am currently unavailable until further notice.</p>
<p>For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries.  </p>
<p>Recovery Road is looking to be pretty long and intense since my right foot was the only spared body part.  </p>
<p>I will provide an update once things become more clear.</p>
<p>Should you need to reach me in the meantime, please contact info@tina-michelle.com.</p>
