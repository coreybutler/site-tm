<h2 id="-announcement-"><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT</strong></h2>
<p>Move Your Axis and private dance instruction need to stay on hold until further notice.  At this point, it is entirely possible that this will become permanent.</p>
<p>For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries.  After taking a financial break, I am back to visiting with my doctors again.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are only able to address two body parts at a time.  Recovery Road is looking to be pretty long and intense since my right foot was the only spared body part.  </p>
<p>I will provide an update once things become more clear.  </p>
<p>If I don’t have the opportunity to talk with you before the holiday, Happy 4th of July!</p>
