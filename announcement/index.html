<h2 id="-announcement-"><strong>ANNOUNCEMENT</strong></h2>
<p>Move Your Axis and private dance instruction need to stay on hold until further notice.  It is entirely possible that this will become permanent.  </p>
<p>For those of you who were unaware, I was hit by a truck last summer while I was out running and sustained head to toe injuries.  After taking a financial break, I am back to visiting with my doctors again.  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are only able to address two body parts at a time.  Since my right foot was the only part spared, Recovery Road is looking to be pretty long and intense.</p>
<p>I will provide an update once things become more clear.  For now, I will offer a <a href="http://tina-michelle.com/movebetter">special program</a> for anyone interested. </p>
<p>If I donâ€™t have the opportunity to talk with you before the holiday, Happy 4th of July!</p>
